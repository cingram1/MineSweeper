MineSweeper  -Adam Ingram

Consists of MineSweeper.java, Game.java, and Board.java

Background:
This is a project I completed for my CS232 class in 2014.
This is a MineSweeper game that is played through the command prompt. 

***How To Play***
1. Make sure all files are saved in the same folder.
2. Open the command prompt to the directory the file is saved in. 
3. Type in 'javac MineSweeper.java' to compile the code.
4. Type in 'java MineSweeper' to run the game.
5. Enjoy your game!

General rules for how to play MineSweeper:
Uncover a mine, and the game ends. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing. 
Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding 
squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.
